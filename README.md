I'm Nicole (or Nic, Nico, Nikki...) and I'm a Data Scientist. I have a background in Microbiology and Analytical Chemistry, and a Master's of Science in Data Analytics from Western Governor's University. I work with the talented team of developers at Biolife Solutions, Inc.

I'm currently learning natural language processing, deep learning, and artificial intelligence in Python. I'm also learning how to develop Python projects.

I'm interested in cloud-based computing and modeling, TensorFlow certification, and AWS Machine Learning/Data Analytics certifications.
